					<p>
						I'm a 24-year-old and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself. I love travelling to explore new cultures, and try new foods and flavors. In my free time, I also enjoy cooking up a storm in the kitchen, listening to music, and keeping up with the latest trends in digital marketing. And of course, as a proud Ni√ßoise, I'm a dedicated supporter of OGC Nice.

				<h2>From Cooking to Drumming: My Diverse Range of Hobbies</h2>
					<p>
						One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. I love experimenting with new recipes and flavors, and trying out different cuisines from around the world, while listening to Italian music with a glass of wine. I'm a big fan of reggaeton and Latin trap. <br> Traveling is another passion of mine, I love immersing myself in different cultures and exploring new places. <br> One of my hobby is playing the drums. I played for 2 years during high school but I had to stop because I was moving abroad. I really hope to pick it up again someday, when I have more money. <br> Lastly, I have been dancing for more than 15 years and have experience in a variety of styles, such as ballet, R&B, hip-hop, oriental, and African dance. Dancing allows me to express myself creatively and stay active, and it's something that brings me a lot of joy.

				<h2>From Nice to Paris: My Current Experience as a Digital Marketer</h2>
					<p>
						I'm currently a student at IESEG in the Digital Marketing & Innovation master's program. I'm also working as a Growth Marketer at Supertripper, a startup that manages business travel. For those who aren't familiar with the role, a Growth Marketer is responsible for driving customer acquisition and retention by testing and optimizing marketing strategies across different channels. It's a challenging job, but I love the fast-paced environment and the opportunity to experiment with different tactics. <br> Last September, I left my beloved southern hometown and moved to Paris to pursue this studies and apprenticeship. And guess what? I've fallen in love with this city and I'm planning to stick around for a while. Between the stunning architecture, the delicious food, and the vibrant culture, there's always something new to discover here. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me and to share my experiences with you along the way.

				<h2>From Consulting to Charity: My Future Plans and Aspirations</h2>
					<p>
						After completing my master's degree, my goal is to join a consulting firm as a growth marketer. I believe that working for a consulting firm would provide me with exposure to a wide range of subjects and enable me to rapidly acquire new skills. <br>Eventually, once I achieve some financial stability, I would like to start my own charitable organization. This organization would focus on helping impoverished children who are suffering from hunger. The goal is to provide them with basic needs and, eventually, assist them with their personal and professional aspirations. My initial plan is to launch this organization in Brazil, as my boyfriend is Brazilian and we may eventually move there. I am excited about this project and believe that I can make a real difference in the lives of these children.
